## 长难句专题

* Confucius remarked,'If  a  man  will  constantly  go  over 
  what he has acquired and keep continually adding it has 
  acquirement,he may become a teacher of man.
* 子曰：“温故而知新，可以为师矣”。

### 常见现象：

* 省略现象

* 倒装现象

* 特殊否定

**-All  `would be` well  `were`  reason  the only  judge in the debate.**

**思路**：出现两个系动词，前面`主系表`完整则考虑后面为`倒装句`

**-All  `would be` well**

**-if  reason `were`    the only  judge in the debate.**

- 出现==were, had, should==时为虚拟语气的倒装，提到前面，并可以省略`if`
- 还包含否定，说明  `不同意任意一方的观点`

### 常见考点：

* 简单句

* 并列句

* 复合句

>**The last few days have found me very restless.(拟人手法)This evening as I sat in the yard to enjoy the cool ,it struck me how different the lotus pool I pass every day must look under a fool moon.**
>
>这几天心里颇不宁静。今晚在院子里坐着乘凉，忽然想起日日夜夜走过的荷塘，在这满月的月光里，总该另有一番样子吧。

**解析**：

1. [This evening] `as` I `sat` [in the yard]  [to enjoy  the cool]
   
2. it `struc` me

3. how different the lotus pool `must look`  [under a fool moon.]

4. (that)I `pass`  [every day]**

> **In Europe,as elsewhere,multi-media groups `have been` increasingly successful groups which `bring together` television ,radio,newspaper and publishing houses that `work` in relation to one another.**
>
> 在欧洲，就像其他地方一样，传媒集团日益成功。他们整合了彼此协作的电视行业，广播行业，新闻行业和出版行业。

定于从句翻译原则：`短前长后`   `递归原则`

**in relation to one another**   彼此协作

> **Behaviorists suggest that the child whogrows up in an environment where thereare many stimuli which develop his orher capacity for appropriate responseswill experience greater intellectualdevelopment.**
>
> 行为主义研究学者认为，丰富的刺激因素有利于儿童反应能力的发展，在富于这种刺激因素的环境下成长的儿童，智力会达到更高的水平。

**解析：** 采用递归原则，由下往上翻译

    Behaviorists suggest ...  //行为主义（研究）学者认为
    that the child···will experience greater intellectual development. //儿童的智力发展会达到更高的水平
    who grows up in an environment //儿童成长在···环境下
    where there are many stimuli  //丰富的刺激（因素）
    which develop his or her capacityfor appropriate responses //刺激因素有益于儿童反应能力的发展
